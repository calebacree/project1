Hello and welcome to the README

First of all I need to mention that I used github for my repo and version control, instead of git. I hope that is ok.

The link to the github is here: https://github.com/calebacree/project1

To run this project, type "make" and that will create and start the oss and user executables.
Then, type "./oss" with the correct parameters (I mostly tested with smaller numbers than given in the example, but when doing final testing I used "-n 5 -s 3 -t 7")

The programs will run, print their PID and PPID along with the current iteration, and will end on completion.
